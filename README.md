This is a multi-label binary classification problem. Solutions employ Logistic Regression algorithm and Random Forest Classification algorithm and use pandas.


Result (AUC score) :
1. Logistic Regression model: 0.80
2. Random Forest model: 0.8742690058479532

Conclusion:
1. Random Forest Classification model gives better AUC score than Logistic Regression model for this dataset 
2. when we have a higher volume of relevant information, the accuracy increases
